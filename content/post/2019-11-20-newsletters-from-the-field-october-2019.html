<h1>The ‘dry’ lowlands forests in the north of São Tomé</h1>
<p>Several days of field works were organized in the northern vegetation of São Tomé. Despite the fact this area is easily accessible, its flora remains poorly documented probably because the vegetation has the reputation to be highly degraded. The northern coast of São Tomé is indeed the most populated area of the island. We specifically explored two localited: the valley behind <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/0.3669/6.5797">Praia Ribeira Funda</a> and the protected area of <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/0.3956/6.6032">Praia Das Conchas</a>. The numerous specimens collected in this area still to be properly identified at the herbarium but preliminary observations and identifications already emphasize both the uniqueness of this vegetation for the archipelago and the numerous threats it is facing. Several interesting plant species were observed among which a probably new species of liana of the genus <strong>Uvaria</strong> (Annonaceae), a new species of tree of the genus <strong>Cleistanthus</strong> (Phyllanthaceae). In the southern part of Ribeira Funda (near Ribeira Funda roça), a very interesting patch of relatively intact forest was explored where species such as the endemic trees <strong>Staudtia pterocarpa</strong> (‘Pao vermelho’) and <strong>Mesogyne henriquesii</strong>.</p>
