# Training

A two-weeks training was organized following the kick-off meeting. Many topics were adressed: how to collect and manage plant specimens, how to establish tree inventories, how to identify families and species, how to encode botanical datasets, how to use GPS...

# The 'dry' lowlands forests in the north of São Tomé

Several days of field works were organized in the northern vegetation of São Tomé. Despite the fact this area is easily accessible, its flora remains poorly documented probably because the vegetation has the reputation to be highly degraded. The northern coast of São Tomé is indeed the most populated area of the island. We specifically explored two localited: the valley behind [Praia Ribeira Funda](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/0.3669/6.5797) and the protected area of [Praia Das Conchas](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/0.3956/6.6032). The numerous specimens collected in this area still to be properly identified at the herbarium but preliminary observations and identifications already emphasize both the uniqueness of this vegetation for the archipelago and the numerous threats it is facing. Several interesting plant species were observed among which a probably new species of liana of the genus __Uvaria__ (Annonaceae), a new species of tree of the genus __Cleistanthus__ (Phyllanthaceae). In the southern part of Ribeira Funda (near Ribeira Funda roça), a very interesting patch of relatively intact forest was explored where species such as the endemic trees  __Staudtia pterocarpa__ ('Pao vermelho') and __Mesogyne henriquesii__.
