<h1>The ‘dry’ lowlands forests in the north of São Tomé</h1>
<p>Several days of field works were organized in the northern area of São Tomé where the flora remains poorly documented, probably because the vegetation is highly degraded. We explored the valley behind <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/0.3669/6.5797">Praia Ribeira Funda</a> and the protected area of <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/0.3956/6.6032">Praia Das Conchas</a>. Preliminary observations and identifications already emphasize both the uniqueness of this vegetation and the severe threats it is facing. Several interesting species were observed among which a probably new species of liana of the genus <em>Uvaria</em> (Annonaceae), and a new species of tree of the genus <em>Cleistanthus</em> (Phyllanthaceae). In the southern part of Ribeira Funda (near Ribeira Funda roça), one of the last patch of relatively intact northern forest was explored where species such as the endemic trees <em>Staudtia pterocarpa</em> (‘Pao vermelho’) and <em>Mesogyne henriquesii</em>. This unique evidence of the forest that covered the north part of Sao Tomé is highly threatened and will disappear quite soon if nothing is done.</p>
